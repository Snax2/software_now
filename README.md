Please note that our group originally consisted of 4 students; however, due to the lack of communication and contribution from Vivek Krishan -despite being provided with several opportunities- we have proceeded as a group of three. Pooja was contacted directly regarding this matter as well. 

Concerning Question 1- The Python script contained in Main.py runs well on our personal computers with a small text file. However, trying to run the script using the full version of the exported Combined_text.txt file resulted in over 24 hours of run time before being terminated by the team. We then tried to compute the script on Google Colab. This worked and exported the CSV files as intended. To achieve this, we did have to alter the script; therefore, we have also provided the Python script used in the Google Colab environment, Colab.1.py.
In addition, two files, Combined_text.txt and biobert_entities.csv, are too large to upload to GitHub, so these files are not visible in our public repository. However, they have been added to the zip file submitted to Learnline.
