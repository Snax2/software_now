Student Names and Numbers
Jack Cerne-Plaatsman - s368001
Margo Joseph-Kuo - s373209
Bricke Crain - s363945

Please note that our group originally consisted of 4 students, however due to the lack of communication and
contribution from Vivek Krishan -despite being provided with several opportunities-, we have proceeded as a 
group of three. Looja was contacted reagrding this matter directly as well. 

In relation to Question 1- The python script contained in Main.py runs well on our personal computers with a
small text file. Trying to run the script using the full version of the exported Combined_text.txt file 
resulted in over 24 hours of run time before being terminated by the team. We then tried to compute the 
script on Google Colab. This worked and exported the csv files as intented. To acheive this we did have to
alter the script, therefore have also provided the python script used in the Google Colab environment; 
Colab.1.py.
